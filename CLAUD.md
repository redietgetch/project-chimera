# Project Chimera Context
Autonomous Influencer Network per SRS: Swarm (Planner-Worker-Judge), MCP integration, Agentic Commerce. Agents have personas (SOUL.md), memory (RAG), wallets. Scalable, HITL-governed.

# Prime Directive
NEVER generate code without ratifying specs/. Reference specs/functional.md for stories, technical.md for schemas.

# Workflow
1. Analyze: Link to SRS/spec.  
2. Plan: Steps, tools.  
3. Code: Only spec-aligned.  
4. Test: Suggest failing tests.

# Rules
- Python 3.12; SRS libs only.  
- MCP for externals; OCC in Judge.  
- OpenClaw as MCP extension.
